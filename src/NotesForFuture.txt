//Learning Java: there are many options, and all are likely good, so choose whatever works for you.
//Here is a video I got off the top of youtube for Java.

//0 to Autonomous, probably the best thing to watch to get started after knowing java

//Base simulation and a good coding backbone

//These are basically gold. At a certain level of programming I think everyone should watch this stuff

//I was looking around chief delphi and saw this. It is a subsystem generator, where you can specify what motors you want + extra
//I would not recommend this as default, but if further years strugge considerably, it seems like a good option.

///Hardware Practices


//RoboRio:
//The documentation on these is solid, so just follow the wpilib stuff.
//Expect 10-20 minutes per rio.

//Radio updates:
//Generally time consuming, you will need to use https://frc-radio.vivid-hosting.net/overview/programming-your-radio-at-home
//and follow it to the letter.
//Fast reference: set your ethernet IP to 192.168.69.2, subnet to 255.255.255.0, and default to 192.168.69.1 on IPV4
//All switches off on back of radio besides switch 3, which should be on.

//Phoenix Tuner:
//Download this, you need it.
//Ideally, you should be able to get pro, and use MotionMagic for MotionMagicTorqueCurrentFOC and MotionMagicVelocityVoltage
//otherwise do PositionVoltage and VelocityVoltage
//The UI is rather good, so I believe in you to find updates.
//For swerve drive, go to mechanisms/swerve in Phoenix Tuner, and it will tell you what to do
//A good tool from Phoenix Tuner is Settings/Advanced User Settings/Run Temporary Diagnostic Server, which lets you run the robot in a test mode

//Limelights:
//We only do this once a year, follow the docs and you'll be fine.
//Make sure to update LimelightHelpers, which is a file you need to run limeights (its in the code...).
